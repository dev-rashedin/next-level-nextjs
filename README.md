#  Next-Level Next.js

> My complete Next.js learning journey — notes, experiments, patterns, and best practices as I level up with Next.js.

This repository is a **living notebook** of everything I learn about **Next.js**, from fundamentals to advanced concepts.  
It’s primarily for **my own understanding**, but if it helps another developer along the way, that’s a big win.

---

## ✨ What This Repo Is

- 📚 Structured notes written while learning
- 🧪 Small experiments and proof-of-concepts
- 🧱 Common patterns and real-world practices
- ❌ No tutorial copy-paste, only things I actually understand
- 🔄 Continuously evolving as I learn more

This is not a polished course — it’s a **growth log**.

## 🧠 Why “Next-Level”?

Because the goal isn’t just to *use* Next.js —  
it’s to **understand it deeply**, one level at a time.
